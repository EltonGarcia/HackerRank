- Problem:
Filter a given array of integers and output only those values that are less than a specified value . 
The output integers should be in the same sequence as they were in the input. 
The purpose of this challenge is to learn how to write your own implementation of a filter function. We recommend not using the inbuilt library function.

- Sample Input: 3, 1, 0, 9, 8, 2, 7, 5, 1, 3, 0
- Sample Output: 2, 1, 0

- Explanation: 2, 1 and 0 are the list elements that are less than the X delimiter, 3. They are displayed in the same order as they were in the original list.
